# PartPacker
## All credits go to the original developersðŸ¤—

This repo is packaged into 2d1ff1cult/JPL-Su2025-2d3dgen, so nothing else is required here.

# Some notes:
1. app.py has been modified from the original repo to allow for output of multiple .ply files of each segmented mesh part, as opposed to a monolithic .glb
2. Added `block.launch(share=True)`. Allows for sharing of a link to another person with inference performed on your local machine
   - This is supposed to be done in the script `bootstrap.bat` in 2d1ff1cult/JPL-Su2025-2d3dgen, but has been removed since `app.py` here has already been modified
